# 🏛️ Civilization-Style Strategy Game (Java + JavaFX)

A turn-based strategy game inspired by **Sid Meier’s Civilization VI**, built entirely in **Java** and rendered using **JavaFX**.
The project features a **client-server architecture** with **multithreading**, enabling multiple players to interact in the same world simultaneously.

## 🎮 Overview

This project is a recreation and simplification of core mechanics found in *Civilization VI*. Players can:

* Expand their territory
* Manage resources
* Build units and structures
* Compete or cooperate with other players on the same server

The goal was to develop a fully functioning strategy game system while practicing object-oriented game design, GUI development, and network programming.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Game Design

* Inspired by **Sid Meier’s Civilization VI**
* Turn-based gameplay with a tile-based world
* Units, cities, buildings, technologies, and resource management
* Clear separation between game logic, UI, and networking layers

### 🎨 Graphics (JavaFX)

* Fully implemented GUI using **JavaFX**
* Interactive map and game UI
* Smooth animations and event handling

### 🌐 Networking

* **Client–Server architecture** with sockets
* Multiple players can join the same world
* Real-time communication between client and server

### 🧵 Multithreading

* The server handles multiple clients concurrently using Java threads
* Thread-safe data structures and synchronization
* Ensures responsive gameplay and stable multiplayer sessions

## 📄 Project Goals

This project was originally built to gain experience in:
* Java and JavaFX
* Real-time multiplayer networking
* Designing GUI-based applications
* Architecting a game system from scratch
* Multithreaded server design
